## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a Unit Conversion app using a Figma design. The results are shown to users when they click the `Convert` button.

### Stretch Goals

I did the light and dark modes, and the app selects the correct one according to the system settings. I didn't give the user the option to change the themes on the website because I didn't want to mess with the design.

## My process

### Built with

-   Figma
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was very straightforward, and I did it mainly as practice. The only thing that challenged me was how to get rid of the default arrows that show up inside `input` elements of type `number`.

### Continued development

I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable with my heavy use of the `calc` CSS function. For my following projects, I should stop using them so often.

### Useful resources

-   [MDN - min()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min) - For the first time, I had to dynamically use the minimum of two CSS lengths; this article showed how easy it is to get that.
-   [Stack Overflow - .toFixed()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11832914/how-to-round-to-at-most-2-decimal-places-if-necessary) - I asked Google how to round a number to 3 decimal places and found the answer here.
-   [W3 Schools - Hide Arrows From Input Number](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hide_arrow_number.asp) - This article has a simple example, and it was all I needed.
